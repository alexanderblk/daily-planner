# Daily Planner Challenge

## Description
This project is a simple calendar application that allows the user to schedule their work day. The calendar includes time blocks for each hour of the work day, and the user can enter a task or event in the text area for each time block. The user can also save their tasks or events to local storage by clicking the save button next to each time block. The calendar displays the current date and time at the top of the page.

# Challenges

I found moment.js quite easy to understand, however I have faced a few challenges, such as:

1. Understanding how to use the Bootstrap grid system to create the layout for the calendar: It took me a while to understand how to use the Bootstrap grid system to create the layout for the calendar, including dividing the page into equal-width columns and rows.

2. Figuring out how to display the current date and time: It was a bit of a challenge to figure out how to use JavaScript to get the current date and time and display it at the top of the page.

3. Implementing the functionality to save and retrieve tasks or events from local storage: It took me some time to understand how to use the localStorage API to save and retrieve tasks or events from local storage.
